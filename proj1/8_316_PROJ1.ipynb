    "<h3>Introduction to Gravitational-Waves</h3>\n",
    "\n",
    "The existence of gravitational waves (GW) was first predicted by Albert Einstein in his General Theory of Relativity in 1916. He found that the linearized weak-field equations had wave solutions. By analogy to electromagnetism, time variation of the mass quadrupole moment of the source is expected to lead to transverse waves of spatial strain. The existence of GW was first demonstrated in 1974 by the discovery of a binary system composed of a pulsar in orbit around a neutron star by Hulse and Taylor [[1]](https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/1975ApJ...195L..51H/abstract). However, direct detections of GW did not arrive until 2016. In that year, The LIGO (The Laser Interferometer Gravitational-Wave Observatory) collaboration reported the first direct detection of GW from a binary black hole system merging to form a single black hole [[2]](https://journals.aps.org/prl/abstract/10.1103/PhysRevLett.116.061102). The observations reported in this paper and futher GW detections wprovide new tests of generay relativity in its strong-field regime, and GW observations have become an important new means to learn about the Universe.\n",
    "\n",
    "In this project, you will reproduce the results reported in [[2]](https://journals.aps.org/prl/abstract/10.1103/PhysRevLett.116.061102) with LIGO open data. This tutorial will show how to analyze a particular GW event GW150914 (the first GW ever detected). In the tutorial, you will find how to download the data collected by Handford Observatory starting from Mon Sep 14 09:16:37 GMT 2015, plot the strain, whiten and filter the strain, plot a q-transform of the data, and extract the features of the source with a simple analytic model. After getting familiar with the basic analysis methods, you need to explore more events, check the consistence between detectors, match numerical relativity waveform template to extract accurate information of the source, compare with LIGO published results, and develop a machinery to search GW event within a long time range."

    "Next, we can try to analyze data through multiple detector streams. Recall that LIGO employs various detectors (Hanford-H1, Livingston-L1, Virgo-V1) to decrease their false positive rate and identify the region in the sky where the GW arrives from. This can be useful to alert the multimessenger astronomy community of an interesting event - think when Binary Neutron Star (BNS) merger [GW-170817](https://journals.aps.org/prl/abstract/10.1103/PhysRevLett.119.161101) was successfully detected by LIGO and allowed observatories in various EM-wavelengths to point their telescopes at the event, allowing for experimental evidence of the creation of heavy-metals whose origin was previously a mystery. Since detectors are located thousands of miles from each other, the only seemingly correlated signal between each should be a GW.\n",
    "\n",
    "In this section, we will correlate the signals from H1, L1, and V1 from [GW200129_065458](https://www.gw-openscience.org/eventapi/html/GWTC-3-confident/GW200129_065458/v1). First, read in the data and perform the normal bandpassing and whitening:"
