We are going to do the Ising model in way that is a little bit different than what you have done in the past. We are going to do the Ising model with Deep learning. The first part of this project will largely follow work done in this nature paper\n",

    "### Step 1.1: The lattice Ising Model \n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "The Ising model is a mathematical model used to describe the behavior of a collection of interacting magnetic moments, such as atoms in a solid or spins in a lattice. The model is named after Ernst Ising, a physicist who first proposed it in 1925.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### 1.1.1   Setting up Model\n",
    "\n",
    "In the Ising model, each magnetic moment is represented by a spin variable, which can take on the values of +1 or -1. The model assumes that these spins interact only with their nearest neighbors in a lattice, and that the interaction between them is influenced by an external magnetic field.\n",
    "\n",
    "The Hamiltonian of the Ising model describes the energy of the system, and is given by:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$\n",
    "H = -J \\sum_{i,j} s_{i} s_{j} - \\mu_{b} \\sum_{j} B_{j} s_{j}\n",
    "$$\n",
    "\n",
    "where J is the exchange interaction strength between neighboring spins, $\\mu$ is the magnetic moment of each spin, $B_{j}$ is the external magnetic field, and the first sum is taken over all pairs of nearest-neighbor spins in the lattice.\n",
    "\n",
    "The Ising model exhibits a phase transition, which is a sudden change in the behavior of the system as a parameter is varied. In the absence of an external magnetic field (B=0), the model exhibits a phase transition at a critical temperature known as the Curie temperature (Tc). Below the critical temperature, the system exhibits long-range order, with all spins aligning in the same direction, resulting in a net magnetization. Above the critical temperature, the system becomes disordered, with spins pointing in random directions, and the net magnetization vanishes.\n",
    "\n",
    "The critical behavior of the Ising model at the phase transition is described by universal scaling laws, which are independent of the microscopic details of the system. These scaling laws have been used to study a wide range of physical systems, including magnets, fluids, and even social networks.\n",
    "\n",
    "As a first step write (split the below code into multiple steps to build the concept and guide the the student)\n",
    "\n",
    "As an example of how we will setup the Ising model, see the initialize code. "

    "In this part of the tutorial, we will explore the methods of lattice Quantum Chromodynamics. Quantum Chromodynamics is the theory that describes the strong interaction between quarks and gluons, which are fundamental particles that make up mesons and hadrons. These particles constitute the majority of visible matter in the Universe. QCD is a crucial component of the Standard Model (SM) and is used to investigate physical phenomena such as the anomalous magnetic moment of the muon and the interactions of Dark Matter with Nuclei.\n",
    "\n",
    "Due to its large coupling constant, QCD cannot be studied using perturbation theory. Well-established non-perturbative method, lattice QCD enables computations of physical observables though numerical simulations. Some of the most famous results obtained with lattice QCD are the study of quark potential, hadron spectrum, and hadron structure.\n",

Despite being the simplest interacting theory, it is also one of the most effective theoretical tools for studying critical phenomena in a wide variety of physical systems. Additionally, the Higgs field in the SM is a scalar field that breaks the weak isospin symmetry of the electroweak interaction and generates mass to many particles.\n",

    "\n",
    "The Ising model and scalar field theory are seemingly different models at the microscopic level, but they share some fundamental properties that make them belong to the same universality class.\n",
    "\n",
    "One of the key similarities is the global symmetry $Z_2$, which is the symmetry of the Ising model with respect to the flipping of all spins. In scalar field theory, this symmetry corresponds to the invariance of the Lagrangian under the transformation $\\phi \\rightarrow -\\phi$, where $\\phi$ is the scalar field.\n",
    "\n",
    "Another important property shared by the two models is that they both undergo a phase transition at a critical temperature or coupling strength, respectively. At this critical point, the correlation length diverges, and the system exhibits scaling behavior that is independent of the microscopic details of the system.\n",
    "\n",
    "This scaling behavior is described by critical exponents, which characterize the power-law behavior of various physical observables near the critical point. These critical exponents are universal, meaning that they are the same for all models in the same universality class, regardless of the specific microscopic details.\n",
    "\n",
    "In summary, while the Ising model and scalar field theory may be very different at the microscopic level, they share some fundamental properties that make them belong to the same universality class. This universality allows us to study and understand the critical behavior of these models without needing to know their microscopic details, but only their macroscopic properties.\n"

    "\n",
    "In lattice QCD the concept of continuous space-time is replaced with a 4D Euclidean lattice that has a constant lattice spacing denoted as $a$. The degrees of freedom in lattice QCD are classical field variables (rather than operators) that reside on the lattice. The Euclidean action $S_E$ of the system is discretized on the lattice such that in the limit $a → 0$ the Euclidean continuum action is obtained. The Boltzmann weight factor $e ^{S_E}$ is used in subsequent computations. In order to study Euclidean correlators, the operators that appear in them are replaced by functionals that use the classical lattice field variables. The computation of Euclidean correlation functions in lattice QCD involves evaluating these functionals on a given lattice field configuration, weighting them with the Boltzmann factor, and integrating over all possible field configurations. We will mimic the whole approach in this tutorial."

In lattice QCD, one uses the MCMC method to generate configurations ${\\phi}$ with probabilities proportional to $e^{-\\frac{S(\\phi)}{T}}$ and evaluate observables on these configurations. However, this method does not provide direct access to the normalizer of the probability density, $Z(T,V)$, making a study of thermodynamics a challenging problem.\n",

This ratio is then used to compute the partition function at the desired parameters. For instance, a possible approach would be to start from a known analytical value $Z (T_ 0, V)$. Next, one would execute MCMC simulations to compute $\\frac{ Z(T,V)}{Z(T_ 0,V)}$.

As a result, the interval of interest, say $[T, T_0]$, is split into a few small intervals where the overlap is good enough, and MCMC simulations are carried out for every value. This approach is computationally demanding, making the study of QCD thermodynamics a challenging problem.\n",
